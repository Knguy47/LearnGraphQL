# LearnGraphQL
Learning GraphQL with React.js.

## Key Notes
GraphQL requires a root Query (an entry point into our data).
Allows GraphQL to jump to a specific node into our graph data structure.
resolve(parentValue, args){}; is where GraphQL actually goes into our data structure and returns actual data.
